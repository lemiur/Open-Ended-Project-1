# Open-Ended-Project-1

Jakob Zimmerman

This program is designed to display ASCII imagery  on the screen and allow the user/player to interact with it. Unfortunately, the scope of the project spiraled and I ended up needing to rewrite quite a bit of code. Originally, my two classes were a Pixel class and a Screen class, however I realized later on that the Pixel class would be better as a struct, and thus needed to come up with a new and useful additional class. I made a player class to move around the screen but failed to implement the actual movement function. I feel like overall my program is pretty well annotated, and there are few bugs.
